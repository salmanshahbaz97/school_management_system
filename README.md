# School Management System Sample Application

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/salmanshahbaz97/school_management_system.git
$ cd school_management_system
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it by using pipenv:

```sh
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Then install the dependencies:

Once `pipenv` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/management/`.

## TimeEstimation

It will take me around three days to build all this functionality
